    "Important Points regarding writing to files:\n",
    "1. Unlike file reading, the file may or may not exist before performing writing operation. If the file already exists, python with make changes to that file and if no file with the given name exists, a new file will be created. This is true for all write operations except the `'x'` file opening mode. \n",
    "2. The file opening mode:\n",
    "    The file opening mode is passed as 2nd argument to the `open()` method. Our provided value for the file opening mode should state that we want to perform a `write` operation. There are following writing modes available in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. `'w'` (Write Mode): `open(file_path, 'w')`\n",
    "      - Opens the file for writing.\n",
    "      - Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.\n",
    "      - Truncates the file if it exists (deletes its content).\n",
    "   2. `'a'` (Append Mode): `open(file_path, 'a')`\n",
    "      - Opens the file for appending.\n",
    "      - Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist.\n",
    "      - Writes data at the end of the file, preserving existing content.\n",
    "   3. `'x'` (Exclusive Creation Mode): `open(file_path, 'x')`\n",
    "      - If the file does not exist, it is created, and you can write to it.\n",
    "      - If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised, preventing the file from being overwritten.\n",
    "      - When to Use: \n",
    "        - Use `'x'` mode when you want to create a new file but want to avoid accidentally overwriting an existing one. \n",
    "        - This mode is particularly useful in situations where file integrity is crucial, such as when generating reports or logs where you want to ensure each run creates a unique file.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. How do we want to perform our write operation?\n",
    "    1. `write()` : Writes a string to the file.\n",
    "    2. `writelines(a_list_of_lines)`: Writes a list of strings to the file. Each string in the list is written as a line. Unlike `write()`, `writelines()` does not add a newline character (\\n) after each string; you need to include it manually if needed."
